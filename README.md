* I was very much interested in learning new things and practice skills, lessons learned provide a powerful method of sharing ideas for improving work processes, operation, quality, safety and cost effectiveness etc.
* I learn about the addEventListener() method of the EventTarget interface sets up a function that will be called whenever the specified event is delivered to the target.

* i learn about time intervals are called timing events. Executes a function, after waiting a specified number of milliseconds.
